# Daily-Sales_-CRUD-Manager
# Project Summary – Daily Sales CRUD Manager (Pure Python)

# Overview:
This project is a command-line based Daily Sales Manager built entirely in pure Python without using any external libraries, import statements, try-except blocks, or .strip() method. It demonstrates CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for managing daily sales records in memory.

# Key Features:
>Create: Add new sales entries with product name, quantity, and price.
>Read: View all recorded sales in a tabular format.
>Update: Modify existing sales records by selecting their ID.
>Delete: Remove sales entries by ID.
>Data Storage: Uses Python lists and dictionaries to store sales data during runtime.
>Validation: Ensures only valid numeric values for quantity and price (basic checks without exceptions).
>No Imports: Fully self-contained, no external dependencies.
